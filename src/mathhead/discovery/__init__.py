"""
mathhead.discovery — the math *discovery* engine (see docs/IDEAL-ENGINE-ROADMAP.md).

This package is the "matter + experiment" (and, later, "discovery") layers built on top of
MathHead's verification/judge spine. It starts in the finite-graph domain (roadmap v0.1:
finite combinatorics + graph theory).

First stone (this increment):
  * objects    — typed object model (N0): Graph
  * canonical  — isomorphism elimination / canonical labeling (N2)
  * generate   — canonical non-isomorphic generation (N1), pinned to OEIS A000088
  * invariants — property & invariant evaluation (O0/O1)

The judge (MathHead: verify / counterexample / certificate) enters at the refutation and proof
tracks (Q/R) — it is intentionally NOT coupled to this object+invariant layer yet.

Placement note: `discovery` currently lives as a subpackage of `mathhead` purely to reuse the
same tooling (tests, CI, ruff) with zero packaging friction. Architecturally it is the layer
that USES the judge, not a part subordinate to it; it may be promoted to a sibling package
later (see docs/discovery/DECISIONS.md, ADR-D0001).
